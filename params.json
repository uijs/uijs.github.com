It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"# Welcome to uijs\r\n\r\n__uijs__ is (yet another) cross platform mobile UI toolkit for apps.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to create a UI software stack for mobile apps that looks and behaves like native mobile UI. Current stacks like [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/), [jQTouch](http://www.jqtouch.com) and [Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch) are doing an excellent job with HTML5. We thought it would be interesting to try out something a little different and use the HTML5 canvas as our basis for the entire UI system.\r\n\r\nOur thesis, which is yet to be proven, is that since we have almost full control on both rendering and behavior we might be able to create a great experience, which mobile users are accustomed to in native apps today.\r\n\r\nuijs's codebase is maintained on [github](https://github.com) (of course) and published via [npm](npmjs.org) as [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org) modules. See [Getting Started](#getting-started) for more information on how to install uijs and build uijs apps.\r\n\r\nWe believe in the [\"batteries are not included\"](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/node-core-vs-userland) philosophy employed in projects like [node.js](http://nodejs.org). For frontend libraries, this is even more critical because one would want to keep the footprint of their app as small as possible, so we didn't want to put too much into the core library.\r\n\r\nuijs is licensed under the [The MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\r\n\r\n#### Stability\r\n\r\n[Stability](http://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index) index: 1 - Experimental.\r\n\r\n__uijs__ is in early stages of development. It is still not mature enough for building actual apps with but we are looking for awesome hackers to join in and solve all those crazy problems. At this point (v0.0.1), uijs is not yet usable. We are building it as you read this (yes!). If you are interested in contributing or trying it out, you are more then welcome. Ping us at the [uijs google group](mailto:uijs@googlegroups.com).\r\n\r\n# Hello, uijs!\r\n\r\nGetting started with uijs is pretty damn easy!\r\n\r\n## Installing uijs-devtools\r\n\r\nYou'll need [node](nodejs.org), which comes bundled with [npm](npmjs.org).\r\n\r\nTo installl the [development tools](https://github.com/uijs/uijs-devtools) globally, type:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm install -g uijs-devtools\r\n```\r\n\r\nVerify that they work:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ uijs\r\nDevelopment tools for uijs apps and modules (version 0.0.1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, create a directory for your app/module and install uijs there:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ cd hello-uijs\r\n$ npm install uijs\r\n```\r\n\r\n> __Contributors__: Instead of using `npm install` you can use `npm link` to reference a local copy of a the `uijs` module. Git clone [https://github.com/uijs/uijs](https://github.com/eladb/uijs) into a local directory, run `npm link` within that directory and then you can use `npm link uijs` to install the `uijs` module as a link. You will see that `node_modules/uijs` will be a symlink instead of a real directory. You might also want to do the same for `uijs-core` and `uijs-controls` within the `uijs` repo. Loving npm!\r\n\r\nThis will create a `node_modules/uijs` directory with the uijs core module.\r\n\r\n## Export an app box from the main module\r\n\r\n__uijs__ apps/modules are [CommonJS](commonjs.org) libraries (`require`, `module.exports`) which export a uijs [box](doc/box.md). A box is a visual rectanglurly-bound element that can draw itself and may have child boxes. In uijs everything is a box.\r\n\r\nLet's create a simple box that prints 'hello, uijs!'.\r\n\r\nCreate a file named `hello.js`:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar uijs = require('uijs');\r\n\r\n// create an app. an app is a box. everything is a box.\r\nvar app = uijs.box();\r\n\r\napp.add(uijs.label({\r\n  x: 10, y: 10, width: 200, height: 50,\r\n  text: 'Hello, uijs!',\r\n  color: '#1c8bdc',\r\n  size: 30,\r\n  bold: true,\r\n  shadowColor: '#ccc',\r\n  shadowOffsetX: 2,\r\n  shadowOffsetY: 2,\r\n  shadowBlur: 5,\r\n}));\r\n\r\n// export the app from the main module. the `uijs` devtool will expect this.\r\nmodule.exports = app;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically what we did here is create an app box with a single child label (which is also a box). The label box has some properties like bounds (`x`, `y`, `width` and `height`), which is common to all boxes and some label-specific properties (`text`, `color`, etc). The function `box.add(child)` is used to add a child box to the app.\r\n\r\nNotice that we do not specify any bounds for the app because by default it will be stretched to fill the entire browser window.\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n    \r\nNow, build and open the resulting html file:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ uijs build hello.js\r\ndist/hello.uijs.js created\r\ndist/hello.uijs.html created\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `uijs` program is the entry point for the [devtools](https://github.com/uijs/uijs-devtools). We use the `build` command, passing it `hello.js` as the input. Type `uijs -h` for usage.\r\n\r\n`build` created two outputs: `dist/hello.uijs.js` and `dist/hello.uijs.html`:\r\n\r\n * The .`js` file is our app bundled using \r\n   [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify). It basically allows \r\n   including a uijs app using a `<script>` tag within any HTML document.\r\n * The `.html` file is a standard uijs HTML shim with the bundled app\r\n   embedded and contains the uijs bootstrapping code. In most \r\n   cases, you will only need this file to serve your app to clients via CDN or \r\n   some other static file server.\r\n\r\nOpen `dist/hello.uijs.html` with a web browser and you should see something like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://raw.github.com/uijs/uijs/master/doc/hello1.png)\r\n\r\nYeah!\r\n\r\n## Working iteratively\r\n\r\nPassing `-w` to `uijs build` will start a file watch on the directory and automatically rebuild when your code changes, so you can work iteratively and refresh the browser window.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ uijs build hello.js -w\r\nWatching hello-uijs exclude: [ 'dist', 'node_modules', '.git', /\\.tmp.+/ ]\r\ndist/hello.uijs.js created\r\ndist/hello.uijs.html created    \r\n...\r\nhello.js changed. rebuilding\r\ndist/hello.uijs.js created\r\ndist/hello.uijs.html created    \r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nPretty useful!\r\n\r\n## Binding attributes to functions\r\n\r\nOne of uijs's freakingly awesome features is it's binding system. You can read more about \r\nit [here](doc/binding.md). Simply put, you can `bind` any box property to a function \r\nand `watch` any property for changes (even if they are bound to functions (hell, yeah!)).\r\n\r\nLet's edit `hello.js` and bind the label's text to something useful:\r\n\r\nReplace this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  text: 'Hello, uijs!',\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  text: uijs.bind(function() { return window.innerWidth + 'x' + window.innerHeight; }),\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you should see something like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://raw.github.com/uijs/uijs/master/doc/hello2.png)\r\n\r\nIf you change the browser window dimensions, you should see these values change immediately.\r\n\r\n## Running on a mobile device\r\n\r\nuijs is all about mobile apps, so we are trying to make it super easy to serve your app for development and access it through the local network via your mobile browser.\r\n\r\nExecute:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ uijs debug hello.js -w\r\nWatching /Users/eladb/hello-uijs exclude: [ 'dist', 'node_modules', '.git', /\\.tmp.+/ ]\r\ndist/hello.uijs.js created\r\ndist/hello.uijs.html created\r\nstarting debugger for dist/hello.uijs.js\r\nuijs debugger listening on port 5000\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the debugger is listening on port 5000. Now all you need to do is point your mobile device to `http://<your-machine-ip-address>:5000` and your app should show up.\r\n\r\nSince most mobile browsers do not have a console window, if you use `console.log` in your codebase, those logs will be outputed on the console of your host machine, making your life so much better.\r\n\r\nSince we used `-w`, the file watch will also work in this mode.","name":"uijs.org"}
